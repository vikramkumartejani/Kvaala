                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Kvaala Florida Map Service:</strong> Our Service provides subscribers with access to an online, interactive map covering locations and information throughout Florida. The map's content is organized into various segments based on theme or target audience, including but not limited to Tourism, Food, Culture, Adventure, Shopping, For Singles, For Couples, For Families, and For Retirees. These segments allow you to explore selected locations, services, attractions, and points of interest relevant to each category.</p>
                            
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Scope of Content:</strong> The subscription grants you access to the map and its listings. No additional content (such as additional context, printed materials or personalized guides) is provided beyond the online map itself. The value of the subscription lies in the collection of locations, services, attractions and points of interest connected to the chosen segments on the map.</p>
                            
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Prohibited Activities:</strong> You agree not to misuse the Service. In particular, you shall not:</p>
                            <ul class="terms-list">
                                <li>Attempt to copy, reproduce, screenshot, scrape, download, or create derivative works from the map data or content, except as allowed by law or with our prior written permission.</li>
                                <li>Use any automated means (including robots, spiders, or other data mining tools) to access, monitor, copy, or scrape any portion of the Service's content or data.</li>
                                <li>Use the Service for commercial purposes or make the content available to non-subscribers (for example, by sharing your access link publicly or redistributing the data).</li>
                                <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, hack, or disrupt the functionality or security of the website or map platform.</li>

                            <h2 class="terms-section-title">Content Accuracy and Updates</h2>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Data Updates:</strong> We strive to keep the map information up-to-date and accurate. Our goal is to update the map data at least twice a year, and we estimate that information on the map will be, at most, about generally within 6 months old. However, we do not guarantee that all information is current or error-free at all times. Some data may be outdated or may have changed since the last update.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Accuracy Disclaimer:</strong> While we endeavor to ensure that information on the map is updated and correct, we rely on various sources (including third-party data) to provide the content. Therefore, Kvaala makes no warranties or guarantees about the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the information and listings provided. We strongly recommend that users independently verify critical details, such as operating hours, prices, and availability, directly with third-party providers before finalizing travel plans. Users should independently confirm important details (such as location, contact information, and current offerings) before making decisions based on the map.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>No Liability for Reliance:</strong> By using the Service, you understand and agree that Kvaala will not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from your reliance on information obtained through the map. This includes, for example, situations where a listed restaurant, shop, or attraction is no longer operating or has changed its offerings. The Service is provided for general informational purposes "as is," and you assume full responsibility for how you use or interpret the content.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Categories and User Relevance:</strong> We have included a broad range of categories and segments in our Florida map to cover many interests and life stages. However, we acknowledge that not all categories or content will be relevant to every userâ€™s personal situation. The inclusion of certain segments (for example, a "For Retirees" segment or a "For Singles" segment) is based on our vision to serve diverse groups. No offense or exclusion is intended if some categories do not apply to you or align with your stage of life. Users are encouraged to simply focus on the segments that interest them and disregard those that do not. If you have feedback about the segments or find any content concerning, please contact us (see Contact Information below) and we will consider your input for future updates.</p>

                        <div class="terms-section" id="subscription">
                            <h2 class="terms-section-title">Subscription Terms</h2>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Eligibility:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to purchase this subscription. By subscribing, you represent that you meet this eligibility requirement. The Service is intended for personal, non-commercial use by the subscriber. You may not transfer or resell your subscription to others.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Subscription Model:</strong> The Kvaala Florida Map Service is offered as a monthly subscription. This means you will pay for access on a month-to-month basis. Currently, we offer a single subscription plan: one-month access, renewing each month until canceled. We do not require you to commit to long-term contracts; your subscription automatically renews every month, giving you continued access to the Service, unless and until you cancel.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>No Account Required:</strong> In order to simplify access, users do not have to create a user account to use the Service. Subscription access may be provided via alternative methods (such as a unique access link, code, or authentication tied to your purchase). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any access credentials (for example, not sharing a private access link or code). The subscription is personal and non-transferable â€“ it is meant for the individual purchaserâ€™s use only. If we detect abuse (such as sharing access publicly or with multiple people), we reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access without a refund. We are committed to a fair process and will investigate suspected abuse before taking action.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Subscription Access:</strong> Upon successful purchase of the subscription, you will be granted access to the online interactive map for the paid subscription period (one month). The content accessible to you will include all the segments and categories described above. (Note: Some features may require an active internet connection; you are responsible for any internet charges. We are not responsible if an interruption in your internet service or device issues prevent you from accessing the map.)</p>

                        <div class="terms-section" id="pricing">
                            <h2 class="terms-section-title">Pricing and Payment</h2>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Subscription Fee:</strong> The price of the monthly subscription (the "Subscription Fee") will be disclosed to you at the time of purchase. All prices are listed in U.S. dollars (USD) unless otherwise noted. By completing your purchase, you agree to pay the Subscription Fee and any applicable taxes or transaction charges. The Subscription Fee is charged in advance for each subscription period (each month). Any future changes to the Subscription Fee will be communicated to you in advance, as detailed in the "Changes to Service and Terms" section.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Billing:</strong> Since this is a month-to-month subscription, your payment method (e.g., credit card) will be charged the Subscription Fee on a recurring monthly basis. The charge will occur on the same calendar day each month as your initial purchase date (or the last day of the month if an equivalent date does not exist in a shorter month). If a payment fails or cannot be processed (e.g., due to an expired credit card or insufficient funds), we may attempt to reprocess the payment. If payment remains unsuccessful, we reserve the right to suspend your access to the Service until payment is received. You are responsible for ensuring your payment information is accurate and up-to-date.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>No Refund Policy:</strong> All sales are final. Kvaala maintains a no-refund policy on subscription fees. Once a subscription period has been paid for, you will not be eligible for a refund of that periodâ€™s fee, even if you decide to stop using the Service midway. The reason for this policy is that upon payment, you immediately gain access to the full value of the Service for that period (i.e., the map content). We encourage you to use any free previews or descriptions on our site to determine if the Service meets your needs before subscribing. If you encounter any technical issues or have concerns, please contact our support team â€“ while we do not issue refunds, we will do our best to address problems and ensure you can access the Service as intended. In cases of severe, demonstrable service failures attributable solely to Kvaala, we may, at our discretion, offer service credits or extensions of access.</p>

                            <h2 class="terms-section-title">Cancellation and Renewal</h2>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Automatic Renewal:</strong> Your monthly subscription will automatically continue each month until you cancel. By subscribing, you authorize us to charge your provided payment method automatically each month, without further action by you, at the then-current Subscription Fee.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Cancellation by You:</strong> You may cancel your monthly subscription at any time to prevent future renewal charges. To cancel, please use the self-service cancellation link provided in your original purchase confirmation email or contact our support team at support@kvaala.com. Cancellation must be available in a manner at least as easy as the method you used to subscribe.Cancellation will be effective at the end of your current paid monthly billing period. You will retain access to the Service for the remainder of the period you have paid for.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>No Refund on Cancellation:</strong> As noted above, when you cancel, you will not receive a refund for the current subscription month. You simply will not be billed for subsequent months. We do not offer refunds for partial use of the Service or for forgetting to cancel in time. It is your responsibility to manage your subscription and cancel if you do not want to renew.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Cancellation by Us:</strong> We reserve the right to terminate or refuse the subscription service to any individual at our discretion, for example, in cases of fraud, abuse, violation of these Terms, or other legitimate reasons. If Kvaala ends your subscription early due to no fault of yours (for instance, if we decide to discontinue the Service entirely), we may provide a pro-rata refund for the remaining unused period of your subscription. However, if termination is due to your violation of these Terms (e.g., misuse of the content, sharing access, etc.), we will generally provide you with notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure the breach (if curable) before termination, unless the breach is severe, immediate, or ongoing (e.g., fraud, public sharing of access credentials). In such cases, no refund will be provided. We will generally provide notice to you if we cancel your subscription, along with the reason and the effective date of termination.</p>

In no event shall Kvaalaâ€™s total aggregate liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to the use of the Service exceed the greater of: (a) one hundred U.S. dollars ($100.00), or (b) the total amount of subscription fees paid by you to Kvaala in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. The limitations in this section shall apply to any theory of liability, whether based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, and whether or not Kvaala has been informed of the possibility of any such damage. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Indemnification:</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Kvaala and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim or demand (including reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees) made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms, your violation of any law or regulation, or your infringement of any rights of a third party in connection with your use of the Service. This means if someone else sues us because of something you did in violation of these Terms, youâ€™ll take responsibility for the costs.</p>

                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>No Account - Minimal Data:</strong> Because we do not require account registration, the personal information we collect is limited. However, by purchasing the subscription, you will be providing certain information (for example, your name, email, and payment details) to process the transaction. We handle this information in accordance with our Privacy Policy (please refer to our Privacy Policy for details on how we collect, use, and protect your data). It is important that you review our separate Privacy Policy for a comprehensive understanding of our data practices. Generally, we use your email or contact only for providing access to the Service, sending subscription confirmations/receipts, and important updates about the Service or your subscription.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Payment transactions may be handled by third-party payment processors.

This data will not identify you personally. Since you do not log in, any such analytics are on the Service usage as a whole and not tied to individual identities.</p>

This could include adding or removing features, updating the software platform, changing the visual design, or altering the content available. We will endeavor to notify subscribers of significant changes (especially any that would materially affect use of the Service). However, there may be instances (such as urgent security updates or third-party content removal) where changes are made with little or no notice. You acknowledge that the content and nature of the Service may evolve over time, and that not all changes will be individually communicated.</p>
                            <p class="terms-text"><strong>Changes to Terms:</strong> We may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time (for example, to reflect changes in the law, updates to our Service, or clarifications). When we make material changes to these Terms (such as a change in the Subscription Fee), we will provide you with advance notice via the email address associated with your subscription. Your continued use of the Service after a price change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the new Subscription Fee. For other significant changes to the Terms, we will post the updated Terms on our website and provide notice via email. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically. Continued use of the Service after changes have been posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
